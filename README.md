# ESP32BusDash
Instrument cluster web dashboard and CAN Sniffer code reader for IC Bus CE300 with ESP32

The dashboard decodes standard fixed-layout J1939 application PGNs. The primary gauge mappings are:

- PGN 61444 (EEC1): SPN 190 engine speed, bytes 4-5, 0.125 rpm/bit.
- PGN 65198: SPNs 1087/1088 service-brake air pressure, bytes 3/4, 8 kPa/bit.
- PGN 61445 (ETC2): SPN 524 selected gear, byte 1, offset -125; displayed as R/N/D/4/2/1.
- PGN 65248: SPN 245 total vehicle distance, bytes 5-8, 0.125 km/bit.
- PGN 65217 (VDHR): SPN 917 high-resolution total vehicle distance, bytes 1-4, 5 m/bit.
- PGN 65265 (CCVS1): SPN 70 parking brake switch, byte 1 bits 3-4.
- PGN 61441 (EBC1): SPN 563 ABS active status, byte 1 bits 5-6.
- PGN 65226 (DM1): diagnostic lamp status and active DTCs.

These PGNs are not DM15, DM13, DM16, or DM1 multi-SPN diagnostic containers. Their SPNs are defined at fixed bit/byte positions by the J1939 application-layer message definitions.

The park-brake indicator accepts only the defined off/on states and requires three consecutive valid frames before changing state. AIR1 remains decoded according to the standard 8 kPa/bit service-brake fields at bytes 3 and 4; a vehicle-specific CAN capture is needed before applying any alternate calibration.
